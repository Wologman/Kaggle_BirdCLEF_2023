# Kaggle_BirdCLEF_2023

I learned a lot from this year, but didn't do so well in the leaderboard.  But it really helped for future projects, in and outside of Kaggle.

I played about this year with augmentation, but spent much of my time trying to master the idea of breaking my spectrogram up into two halfs, and stacking them on top of each other to make a square image with better temporal resolution.  This didn't seem to help in the end.  I also tried to tackle the weakly labeled nature of the dataset by a threshold based pseudolabelling scheme on the training data with the first iteration of the model.
